Strings
1. String Data Type in Python:

In Python, a string is a sequence of characters, enclosed within single (' '), double (" "), or triple (''' ''' or """ """) quotes.
Strings are immutable, meaning you cannot change the characters within a string directly. Instead, you create new strings.
You can access individual characters in a string using indexing, e.g., my_string[0] will give you the first character.
Strings support various built-in methods, such as len(), upper(), lower(), strip(), replace(), and more, for manipulation.
2. String Manipulation and Formatting:

Concatenation: You can combine strings using the + operator.
Substrings: Use slicing to extract portions of a string, e.g., my_string[2:5] will extract characters from the 2nd to the 4th position.
String interpolation: Python supports various ways to format strings, including f-strings (f"...{variable}..."), %-formatting ("%s %d" % ("string", 42)), and str.format().
Escape sequences: Special characters like newline (\n), tab (\t), and others are represented using escape sequences.
String methods: Python provides many built-in methods for string manipulation, such as split(), join(), and startswith().


Certainly! Here's a Python exercise that covers various string operations and built-in functions. Work through the tasks and use the Python documentation or other resources if needed. Feel free to modify the exercise based on your needs.

### Python String Exercise:

1. **String Creation:**
   - Create a string variable named `my_string` with the value "Hello, Python!"

2. **String Length:**
   - Print the length of `my_string`.

3. **Access Characters:**
   - Print the first and last characters of `my_string`.

4. **String Slicing:**
   - Create a new string variable named `substring` by slicing `my_string` to extract "Python."

5. **Concatenation:**
   - Create a new string variable named `new_string` by concatenating `my_string` with " I love programming."

6. **String Repetition:**
   - Repeat `my_string` three times and store the result in a variable named `repeated_string`.

7. **Convert to Uppercase:**
   - Convert `my_string` to uppercase and store it in a variable named `uppercase_string`.

8. **Convert to Lowercase:**
   - Convert `uppercase_string` to lowercase and store it in a variable named `lowercase_string`.

9. **Count Substring Occurrences:**
   - Count the number of occurrences of the substring "o" in `my_string` and print the result.

10. **Find Substring Position:**
    - Find the position of the substring "Python" in `my_string` and print the result.

11. **Replace Substring:**
    - Replace "Python" with "Programming" in `my_string` and store the result in a variable named `modified_string`.

12. **Check String Start and End:**
    - Check if `my_string` starts with "Hello" and ends with "Python!" and print the results.

13. **String Formatting:**
    - Use string formatting to create a new string that says "I have repeated the string 'Hello, Python!' three times."

14. **Whitespace Stripping:**
    - Create a string with leading and trailing whitespace and use the appropriate function to remove the whitespace.

15. **String Splitting:**
    - Split `my_string` into a list of words and print the result.

16. **Joining Strings:**
    - Create a list of words and use the `join` function to join them into a sentence.

17. **Check Alphanumeric:**
    - Check if `my_string` contains only alphanumeric characters and print the result.

Feel free to explore additional string functions and operations as you work through this exercise. This should cover a wide range of commonly used string manipulations in Python.
